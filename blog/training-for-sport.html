      <p>There's nothing simple or easy about writing a training program that properly balances the stresses of sport practice, weight lifting and cardio. I love simplifying complex topics and distilling nuanced ideas into applicable nuggets of knowledge and infographics, but this is a topic that you need to dig into a bit if you really want to understand it. There's a famous quote attributed to Albert Einstein that comes to mind: </p>


      <div class="leftBorderList">
        <h3>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler"</h3>
      </div>

      <p>When programming supplemental exercise for your sport, there are several important ideas and general guidelines to consider. I'm not going to try to cover every possible angle, but I will touch on a handful of key concepts, unpacking each one with more detail and some specific examples from a variety of sports.</p>
        
      <p>You may already accept that resistance training and cardio are valuable assets for enhancing performance and longevity as an athlete, but a lot of people don't understand why they should do anything other than simply practice their sport. While you'll be hard pressed to find a football player who doesn't appreciate the value of heavy weight lifting, some people think it would be <em>detrimental</em> to their sport to lift weights or add cardio. I had a kung fu instructor years ago who taught us exactly that: "don't lift weights, it'll just make you slow and inflexible." This is still a pervasive myth in many circles, so let's start with an examination of why it might be a good idea for athletes to add lifting and cardio to their sport practice.</p>

      <p>(If you're already sold on the benefits of lifting and cardio for enhancing sport performance, you can probably just <a href="#howToStructure">skip to the next section</a>)</p>

      <h1>How can lifting & cardio help you as an athlete?</h1>

      <p>Building strength and power through resistance training facilitates the kind of explosive movement, speed and endurance that is integral to so many sports. In short: it can enhance your performance. If you want to run faster, jump higher, strike and throw harder, grip equipment and other people tighter, then lifting weights will help. Even if all you want to do is run or snowboard without tiring so quickly and dealing with achy joints, lifting can help. Stronger muscles and tendons, denser bones, and more resilient joints can help reduce your risk of injury and pain, especially in any sport that involves high impact or combat.</p>

      <p>That said, there IS a point of diminishing returns. Eventually, adding more weight to your squat will no longer improve your 100m sprint or vertical jump, but taking someone from a 150 lbs squat to a 300 lbs squat is going to noticeably improve their performance in a variety of sport movements, and as a nice bonus normal life challenges and activities will become much easier.</p>

      <p>At this point, someone might ask "Why not just run, jump, throw, etc. to build all those qualities AND get specific skill practice for your sport?" That's a great question, and practicing your sport will certainly cause your body to adapt by getting stronger and faster, but there are two major limitations to this approach:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          It's difficult to apply the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload">progressive overload</a> without turning sport practice into an awkward, less-effective version of lifting
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the sport, it may not be safe or healthy for your joints to just do more practice for the sake of building strength, muscle and endurance
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>With some sports it's more effective to focus on more practice than with others. If you're a cyclist, biking harder and more often will build your leg size and endurance with little risk of pain or injury due to how negligible the impact is. Dedicated lifting for the lower body is still a great idea for best results, but the risk/reward ratio with cycling is pretty solid.</p> 
      
      <p>Some karate schools will have students squat with someone sitting on their shoulders as a form of strength training, and honestly that is a pretty effective way to build strength and size in the legs. They've generally got the right idea, but it's still more effective and less exhausting to slowly progress your barbell squats and lunges over time.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, if you practice a high-impact sport like parkour, it's NOT a good idea to try and build leg strength by simply jumping to and from high ledges more often. If you practice BJJ, repeatedly muscling your way out of arm-bars is a terrible substitute for curl variations on top of simply being poor technique. If you are a boxer, there are much safer ways to strengthen your neck than to simply take more blows to the head during practice.</p>

      <p>Endurance is actually where it makes the most sense to spend more time practicing your sport, so long as that practice doesn't beat you up and fatigue you too much. Having a great aerobic capacity will help you train longer and recover more quickly from any kind of physical activity, but practicing the <em>specific movements and positions</em> of your sport will give you the exact adapations you need to be as efficient as possible. Endurance isn't just about having better overall cardiovascular fitness or a high VO² max: the movement efficiency that comes with having deeply ingrained motor patterns is a big part of the picture, and you can only get that kind of fine-tuned motor skill through many hours of practicing your sport.</p>
        
      <p>Consider the fact that Lance Armstrong ran the Boston marathon in 2008 and barely broke the top 500. Obviously he had world-class endurance and aerobic capacity, and top 500 is nothing to scoff at, but it goes to show that our body adapts to the specific movements we train and general fitness doesn't translate into novel activities as much as we would like. So if you want to have more endurance while sparring or swimming, there's no substitute for sparring and swimming.</p>

      <p>That being said, sometimes it's simply not feasible to add more sport practice, or your sport is a bit too intense to make for effective aerobic exercise, or the sport is just too hard on your joints. Maybe there are only a few BJJ classes at the gym you go to that fit your schedule, or perhaps unfavorable weather impedes your ability to consistently get outside for practicing soccer or ultimate frisbee, or maybe you can only do so many rounds on the heavy bag before your wrists and shoulders ache too much to keep drilling. If you are unable to get in several training sessions a week for any reason, if it's impractical to train at a light and steady enough pace to effectively build aerobic capacity, or if your sport just beats you up too much to do more and more of it, then supplementing with cardio exercise outside of your sport is the next best thing for building up your endurance.</p>

      <p>One last thing to consider is that every sport is going to emphasize a limited set of movements and demands while neglecting others. Rock climbing significantly stresses all the pulling muscles in your back but does very little to train your pressing muscles. Cycling works the legs hard but your upper body is mostly just along for the ride. Rounds of boxing are great for building anaerobic endurance, but unless you like to shadowbox for 30+ minutes straight you'll need some supplemental exercise to build your aerobic capacity.</p>

      <p>In the interest of maintaining overall balance and keeping your body well-rounded, you might consider using lifting and cardio to train the movements and energy systems that are neglected in your sport.</p>

      <h1 id="howToStructure">How to structure your training week</h1>

      <p>The first thing you want to understand is that your training week needs to transition from periods of higher intensity work to periods of lower intensity work, rather than trying to maintain a consistent intensity day after day.</p>
        
      <p>This allows you to consolidate <em>specific types of stress</em> in order to maximize the time your body can recover before you perform that same kind of work again.</p>

      <p>While lifting, cardio and sport practice may seem like completely different activities, and in many ways they are, what they all have in common is that the type of activity you perform is going to emphasize one of your three energy systems more than the others. Each have modalities ranging from heavy and intense to light and easy, and it's important that your training week gradually tapers from one end of that spectrum to the other.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Note that there is often overlap between these systems, ie it's not as simple as one "turning off" as another kicks in; it's more like they work together to contribute varying levels of energy at different points in an activity.</p>
        
      <p>For example, aerobic energy contribution to the 400m sprint <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjexcXl-bmBAxWtMDQIHaKCAR0QFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fworldathletics.org%2Fdownload%2Fdownloadnsa%3Ffilename%3D81529885-c10b-41d5-9087-e26544f877e3.pdf%26urlslug%3Dthe-aerobic-mechanism-in-the-400-metres&usg=AOvVaw0Nxd8-a4IbU35a8RbW2J6h&opi=89978449" target="_blank">has been estimated</a> to lie somewhere between 18% and 70%, depending on the measurement used and the capacities of the athletes tested.</p>

      <p>While these are simplified summaries that leave out details such as fiber type recruitment, neural drive, substrate utilization, etc., the important point to understand is that you can roughly divide types of activity into three major categories and each one stresses the body in unique ways, so if we rotate between them intelligently we can juggle the stresses of our training so as to fit a large amount of total volume into our program without burning out.</p>

      <p>Does it matter in what order you cycle through these kinds of activities? Yes, largely due to how "fatigue tolerant" each one is. As a general rule of thumb, you want to perform the kinds of activities that require the most focus, coordination and intensity of effort while you have the least amount of fatigue. This means early in the session, day or week.</p>

      <p>Let's use the legs as an example. Say we want to perform heavy sets of 2 on the back squat, some high-rep sets of 10-20 on the leg press, and we also want to fit in a 5K run. How we order these activities will make a significant difference in performance. If your legs and brain are both physically and psychologically fatigued from doing leg presses and a run first, there's no way you're going to be able to squat nearly as much weight with as solid of form as you could if you did the squats first thing while you were fresh and focused.</p>
        
      <p>The inverse is not true, however. If your legs are tired from heavy squats and leg presses, this won't have nearly the same impact on a 5K run. Sure, they may feel a bit wobbly at first, but jogging doesn't require a lot of leg strength or neural drive, so you can just go and kind of "zone out" in a way that is less-than-advisable for heavy and hard sets of lifting.</p>

      <p>Whether we're sequencing exercises for a session of training, a day involving multiple activities, or the entire training week we need to keep this general idea of fatigue tolerance in mind. Start the session/day/week with whatever activities require you to be fresh and focused, and gradually transition into the activities that are still viable while you're fatigued.</p>

      <h5>Begin with:</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Heavy</li>
        <li>High Impact</li>
        <li>Explosive</li>
        <li>Technical</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>End with:</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Light</li>
        <li>Low Impact</li>
        <li>Slow</li>
        <li>Simple</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you're a boxer trying to sequence training sessions throughout the week, you would want to start your week with heavy bag work and drilling hard strikes on focus pads.</p>
